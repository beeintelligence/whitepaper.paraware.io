# 5.2.1 Understanding Proof of Computation time (PoCt)

Proof of Computation time (PoCt) is a verification process to prove that a miner has provided the necessary GPU and network bandwidth to the ParaWare network. This exercise helps to ensure that game streaming rewards will be distributed to the miners who claimed that they have delivered high-quality GPU services. Similarly, stakeholders will receive their share of the reward after the game streaming service ends.

The PoCt process will be governed by the verification system preset by the Paraware network (verifier). During game streaming, the ParaWare verifier will periodically challenge each miner to perform the PoCt process. The proof occurs within a SNARK (**Succinct** Non-Interactive **Argument** of Knowledge) framework, and involves the validation of IPFS data stored by both the player and miner in the PoCom process.
