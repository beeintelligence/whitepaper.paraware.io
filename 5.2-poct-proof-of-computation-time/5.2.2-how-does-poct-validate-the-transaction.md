# 5.2.2 How does PoCt validate the transaction?

The ParaWare verifier will request log files from both the player and miner. Upon each passing the IPFS proof, the ParaWare PoCt will compute the QoS of the miner, by evaluating the network latency values from both Miner and Player sectors, and the statistical deviation of the control logs from the typical control logs. It then assigns a score to the Minerâ€™s PlayStream node for that period of service. This goes on until the service terminates, and the overall QoS score is computed as an aggregation of the individual PoCom QoS scores.

Tokens are paid out to each miner and stakeholder immediately upon termination of service, minus any sub-par QoS deductions.
