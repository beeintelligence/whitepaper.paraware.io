# 7.2 Metaverse for everyone

Due to the proliferation of online virtual worlds and the growing online social networks, there has been a flurry of interest and activity surrounding the Metaverse. This has led to numerous advancements in the field. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a rapid acceleration of the Metaverse movement, which has drived an increasing migration of resources (VC funds and manpower) from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0.

The desire for realistic Metaverse has also given virtual reality its long-awaited boost, with headsets selling at an unprecedented rate and decreasing prices. Current state-of-the-art VR 3K headsets from Meta are selling at US$299, but with graphics quality still way short of AAA.

ParaWare allows anyone with a phone or even a low-end VR headset (phone + cardboard VR set) to experience ultra-realistic AAA graphics. This will further drive the adoption of the Metaverse. We are confident that ParaWare will be one of the foundation building blocks for Web 3.0 3D gaming, and also eventually the Metaverse.
