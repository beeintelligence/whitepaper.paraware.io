# 7.1 Real Life Implications

Since ParaWare will handle all the heavy-duty graphics processing on a PlayStream node instead of the playerâ€™s device, the energy consumption of the player device will be constant and minimal. Further, overheating on the device, as well as any delay arising from a weak GPU, will both be mitigated. Moreover, using a low spec device does not mean that the player must settle for low-polygon count low quality rendering. On the contrary, anyone with an entry-level phone purchased after 2018 will now be able to enjoy full AAA graphics via ParaWare.

Suppose a player wants to continue his/her TV ParaWare gaming session lying in bed, he could simply turn off the TV and open up his mobile phone ParaWare client and continue on from where he left off. Beyond that, users can even wear an entry-level VR headset to experience breathtakingly realistic 3D games.
