# A.3 Hardware Requirements

Table 6 shows the minimum required hardware specifications for each ParaWare roles.

The least requirement is placed on the Stakeholder, who need just a crypto wallet and browser to stake their tokens in exchange for potential earnings.

End users (consumers) need minimally a device that can stream Full HD 1920x1080@60fps video smoothly. A minimal bandwidth of 10 Mbps is needed to achieve 60 fps Full HD video streaming.

Developers will need desktop hardware equivalent to 2 VM’s for compilation and simulation as a bare minimum. Typically developers will use a significantly faster GPU or GPU farm for 3D-rendering and ray-tracing.

The heaviest requirements are extolled on Miners, who are the core providers of ParaWare’s game streaming services. Miners will be penalized (by having their staked PWC confiscated) if their received Quality of Service goes below the agreed upon standard. Each mining machine runs multiple VM’s (Virtual Machines), servicing one game per VM per end-user. Thus a Mining machine should minimally serve 2 game connection requests simultaneously (20 Mbps bandwidth), with each game using 12-16 GB of memory and 1 GTX 1080-Ti class GPU. For economies of scale, a mining machine should serve 4 - 16 gamers, which corresponds to 64 GB \~ 256 GB of memory, 4\~16 GTX 1080-Ti class GPU, and 40 Mbps \~ 160 Mbps network bandwidth.
