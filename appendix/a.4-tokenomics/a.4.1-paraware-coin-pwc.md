# A.4.1 ParaWare Coin (PWC)

The ParaWare Coin (PWC) is the protocol token of the ParaWare network. It is a prerequisite for participating in the ParaWare Ecosystem. Developers/Consumers will need PWC tokens in order to deploy their games. To enjoy cloud gaming services, players need PWC. As such, we have established a total lifetime supply of 300 million tokens, to be released over 5 years, according to the schedule shown in Table 7 and Figure 6.

The proportions are as follows. 48% for mining rewards; 20% for investors; 10% for the core team; 10% for stakeholders; 6% for developers; and 6% for the ecosystem. Never more than 300 million PWC will be available in the ecosystem. The entire PWC token supply will be completely issued within 5 years.
