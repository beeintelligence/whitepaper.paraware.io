The supply of PWC is always decreasing, making it a deflationary tokenomic model, which means the market supply of PWC will decline over time. All activities conducted within the Paraware ecosystem will gradually burn the tokens.

Based on a simple demand-supply logic, the PWC token will gradually increase in value over time due to its deflationary design. In addition, demand for the PWC token is expected to increase when it begins to circulate within the ecosystem, which may result in a hyper growth period of the tokenâ€™s value.
