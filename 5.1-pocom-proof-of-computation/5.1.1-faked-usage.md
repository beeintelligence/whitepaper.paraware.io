# 5.1.1 Faked Usage

How can we ensure that authentic log files are stored instead of faked data? This is a hard problem because the miner fully controls their machine, and theoretically can generate fake log files with fake streaming usage, with the goal of earning tokens.

The solution is simple: economics.

Suppose a miner streams games to fake players, and subsequently receives PWC tokens from the fake players. He does not profit at all, but instead incur a transaction cost, because all players (including imposters) must buy/acquire PWC tokens to play the games in the first place. All faked game streaming will result in the transferring of tokens from left hand to right hand, minus the transaction fees.
