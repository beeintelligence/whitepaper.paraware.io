# 5.1.3 Dishonest Players

Suppose a player spent 10 tokens to play a game for 1 hour, and wants to get compensation claiming poor QoS. Currently, there are no manual avenues for the player to claim compensation. Any breach of QoS is automatically determined, and compensation paid out to the players automatically from the staked SLA pool.

It is possible for a player to activate any game and randomly enter control sequences, with the sole goal of messing up the statistical control profile of the game, so as to obtain QoS compensation. Again, this is hard to detect automatically. From a statistical view point, all QoS metrics are compared against the median values, which by itself is resistant to extreme/manipulated values. Further, random game play costs tokens, and the perpetrator is a player/user of ParaWare, strictly speaking.
