# 3.3 WePlay

In traditional surrogate-gameplay, the game account owner must release wholesale his/her login details to the surrogate player. This means that the owner risk losing the game account altogether if the stakes are high.

WePlay is a unique ParaWare feature that offers secured remote surrogate-playing. It allows the game owner and surrogate player to operate the app together, remotely. The owner can enter the login details without revealing it to the surrogate. The surrogate can start gameplay once he is granted control by the owner. The owner can watch the surrogate gameplay, and retract the latterâ€™s access at any time.

Access and play controls are fully logged by WePlay, facilitating a time-based hire of surrogates, in addition to mission-based hire. For example, a game account owner can hire a surrogate with terms like: play for 5 hours at US$20 per hour. The surrogate game play can optionally be recorded and stored for future validation or tutorial reference.
