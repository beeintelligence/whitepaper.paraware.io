# 3.1 AAA Graphics

The hallmark of AAA games is the use of high-quality (aka high-polygon) 3D models everywhere in the game. Figure 2 illustrates the difference between a high-polygon model versus a low-polygon model.

On x86 VM’s, PlayStream supports Windows DirectX and OpenGL, thereby supporting the common 3D engines like Unity3D and Unreal Engine. On ARMv8-64 VM’s, PlayStream supports OpenGL ES and derivatives including Unity3D running on Android. Unreal is also supported.

For high quality AAA Graphics, the cloud VM must be equipped with a decent GPU. All major Nvidia discrete GPU’s such as GTX 1080-Ti are supported on the Windows OS. For ARMv8 VM, the Graviton2 series of Nvidia GPU’s are supported.
