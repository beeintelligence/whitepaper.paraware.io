# 6.1 ParaWare vs other Web3 Platforms

Table 2 compares ParaWare against two other Web3 protocols that share some similarities. Livepeer (LPT) is a crowd-sourced Web3 streaming protocol that aims to reduce the cost of live video streaming by utilizing idle computers and their bandwidth. LPT is similar to ParaWare in spirit, but handles only video streaming with no client controls. Further, LPT solves a one-to-many (one content to many viewer) problem, while ParaWare solves the many-to-many (p2p) problem of game streaming.

The Internet Computer (IPC) is an ambitious project that wants to be the de facto standard for all decentralized apps. It uses a brand new programming language Motoko specifically for writing IPC DAPP (Distributed App), thereby making it incompatible with existing x86 or ARM applications, including games.
