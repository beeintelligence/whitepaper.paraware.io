# 6.3 ParaWare vs Other Cloud Gaming Platforms

For game studios or individual developers, ParaWare can be viewed as a distributed cloud platform that delivers games to the largest audience at the lowest possible cost. This puts ParaWare in direct competition with the major cloud gaming platforms such as Google Stadia and Amazon’s Lumia. Although this is not the market that ParaWare aims to compete in, it is interesting to compare the differences and similarities, as shown in Table 4.

Specifically, Table 5 shows how ParaWare compares to the leading cloud gaming platforms. Among the competitors, Gala is a Web3 gaming platform not based on cloud gaming, while Shadow is a generic cloud provider that simplifies the process of running a cloud VM and streaming its display to an end user’s device. This is akin to accessing a windows remote desktop (or VNC) from the cloud instead of your PC at home. Since Shadow’s VM is designed for general use, the default US$29.99 per month cloud VM does not come with a GPU. For AAA graphics, you need to upgrade to the Power version for an additional US$14.99 per month.

Exceptions: Gala does not stream video, and Shadow is a personal cloud PC that streams video. “1.1 #AAA/#All Games” refers to the number of AAA game titles vs All game titles available/developed for the cloud platform. “3.3 US$ / month” refers to consumer monthly subscription price. (O: Yes; -: No).</p></figcaption></figure>
