# 4.2.2 Miners

Miners provides the computation resources, i.e., PlayStream nodes, for games, services, and API’s to run on. A miner must stake/deposit a certain amount of PWC tokens in the SLA (Service Level Agreement) pool in proportion to the amount of resources they offer. In the event that the miner node fails to deliver a service satisfactorily, the staked tokens will be confiscated and paid as compensation to the end-user.

The proof of Computation Time (PoCt) procedure (see later section for details) begins once gameplay streaming starts. The PoCt procedure will then periodically seal connection log files into an IPFS sector for storage, and ends along with the gameplay. A miner can readily answer any verifier’s request for PoCt by returning the hash result for any stored sector.
