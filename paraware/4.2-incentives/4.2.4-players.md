# 4.2.4 Players

Consumer (Player) - are the end-users (consumers) of ParaWare hosted games/services, which runs on physical machines provided by the Miners. Consumers can access a variety of games and services deployed by the developers. They pay the miner PWC tokens for each minute of streaming video game access and/or each KB of storage. However, their usage could be optionally subsidized by developers, who could pre-pay for a limited amount of play time on ParaWare, i.e., consumers could play/use the game/service for a limited amount of time before forking out PWC to pay for the service.

The “any device” feature of ParaWare allows a consumer to play on one device, e.g., mobile phone, and resume gameplay on any other device such as TV, Laptop. In the event that a consumer experiences poor gameplay due to sub-par quality hosting, he/she will receive compensation PWC tokens (refund) from the SLA pool.
