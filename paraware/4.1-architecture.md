# 4.1 Architecture

![Figure 3. ParaWare Architecture.](../.gitbook/assets/2022-09-02\_164705.png)

Figure 3 shows the architecture of ParaWare, which shows how the different users interact with one another. Specifically, there are 4 types of roles:

1. Player
   1. Play games on any device with video streamed from a dedicated PlayStream node
   2. Control the game via controller pad/joystick, touch screen phone, VR Headset, or PC that has a pre-configured IDP (Input Device Profile)
2. Developer
   1. Write games
   2. Write API’s
   3. Deploy software and services on Miner nodes
3. Miner
   1. Run one or more PlayStream nodes
   2. Stake PWC to guarantee a minimum SLA (Service Level Agreement)
4. StakeHolder
   1. Stake PWC on promising Miners to earn a cut of the revenue

The infrastructure comprises the following components:

1. ParaWare is a Layer 2 protocol that takes care of the following:
   1. Process gameplay requests from players
   2. Provision free PlayStream nodes to serve/run a game
   3. Initialize PlayStream node with the player’s most recent state
   4. Track gameplay state and QoS of each PlayStream node
   5. Ensure payment is made on-time to the respective roles
2. PlayStream cluster of miner nodes
   1. Run the actual game on a VM
   2. Stream gameplay audio-video and data to player device
   3. Receive player control inputs
3. Decentralized storage based on IPFS game state
   1. Read/write game state
   2. Read/write game accounts
   3. Read/write QoS proofs using PoCom and PoCt (see later section)
   4. Store streamed gameplay video (for surrogate playing or manual QoS validation)
