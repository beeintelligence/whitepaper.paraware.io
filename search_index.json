gaming is currently a 1% niche market but is expected to grow at a CAGR (Compounded Annual Growth Rate) of 43% over the next few years. ParaWare is a decentralized protocol created to provide ultra-low-cost delivery of 3D intensive cloud applications/games to generic devices via video streaming. The GPU-hungry (Graphical Processing Unit) application/game runs remotely on a virtual machine (VM), while the app display/screen is streamed in real-time to the end-user’s (players) device. Miners (machine owners) offer up their idle GPU-equipped VM’s to ParaWare players in exchange for ParaWare Coins (PWC). Stakeholders can stake their PWC on promising miners to earn a cut of the miner’s earnings. In addition to 3D applications and games, developers can also create value-added API’s and services such as game-mods, add-ons, search and indexing, ratings, reviews, price-comparison, etc. and deploy them to the VM’s. Miners get paid for providing the computing infrastructure, players pay (miners and developers) for the value-added services and cloud usage time, while developers earn a fee from players who use their services. Everything runs in a transparent and fair Web3 infrastructure, anchored to the cloud 3D gaming market. All in all, think of ParaWare as the Web3-enabled Airbnb of idle GPU’s (homes) and 3D Game Players (lodgers). We are confident that ParaWare can and will gradually evolve to become the defacto crowd sourced infrastructure driving the full adoption of the Metaverse by virtual of the fact that it allows the full immersive Metaverse to be experienced by anyone wearing any entry-level VR headset or device simply by streaming the highest quality AAA 3D graphics directly to it in real-time.\n"},"introduction/1.1-background.html":{"url":"introduction/1.1-background.html","title":"1.1 Background","keywords":"","body":"1.1 Background1.1 Background\nGames serve an essential purpose in society by acting as a primary source of entertainment, fostering social connection, and providing relief, and improving the overall quality of life. Now that we are starting to make a slow recovery from the global pandemic from 2020 to 2021, we are beginning to fully understand how the role of gaming has changed our lives irrevocably.\nAccording to Newzoo's Global Games Market Report for 2021[1], there were 3 billion gamers around the world in 2021, which helped generate revenues of US$175.8Billion. 2.8 billion of the world’s 3.0 billion gamers this year will play on a mobile device. This is compared to 1.4 billion on PC and 0.9 billion on console. The vast majority of the new revenues come from emerging markets, as the infrastructure and economies of regions such as Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Northern Africa continue to expand at a rapid rate.\n2021 Global Players Per Region\n\nThe global cloud gaming market was valued at US$4.5 Billion in 2021, and it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 42.8 percent from 2021 to 2030, reaching US$111.3 Billion by 2030. The expansion of the market is being driven by a variety of factors, some of which include cross-platform gameplays, the growing popularity of cloud gaming, and the ease with which cloud-based games can be accessed.\nSeveral market participants are coming out with new products, collaborating with other businesses, and making acquisitions in order to stay one step ahead of the competition. For example, in May of 2021, Blade and its associated cloud gaming service, Shadow, were acquired by Jezby Ventures, which in turn was established by Octave Klaba, the founder of OVHcloud. Ubitus K.K, Tencent, Sony Group Corporation, Shadow, NVIDIA Corporation, Blacknut, Google LLC, Amazon Luna, and Microsoft Corporation are some of the other major companies that offer cloud gaming end-user services.\n``\n``\n"},"introduction/1.2-cloud-gaming.html":{"url":"introduction/1.2-cloud-gaming.html","title":"1.2 Cloud Gaming","keywords":"","body":"1.2 Cloud Gaming1.2 Cloud Gaming\nCloud gaming is a form of online video gaming that requires no downloads once the client App is installed. This is because games actually run on a remote server in the cloud; only the remote display/screen content is constantly refreshed/sent at 60 FPS (Frames Per Second) to the player over the network, and the player in turns sends control signals (keyboard, control pad, or button push) to the remote server. Think of cloud gaming as watching a controllable video, whereby the video content changes based on your actions/inputs. As most modern devices can stream Full HD video at 60 FPS, a low-end device suffices for anyone to enjoy the latest and greatest 3D titles without having to fork out money to buy expensive consoles or Graphics card. Neither is there a need for large local storage to store 3D models and maps, as all game states are stored remotely on the cloud.\n"},"introduction/1.3-blockchain-and-web-3.0.html":{"url":"introduction/1.3-blockchain-and-web-3.0.html","title":"1.3 Blockchain and Web 3.0","keywords":"","body":"1.3 Blockchain and Web 3.01.3 Blockchain and Web 3.0\nOne key feature of blockchain is immutability, which means that once a transaction is sealed into the distributed ledger, it cannot be altered. As such, blockchains are especially suitable for tracking and storing transaction records that are indisputable and trustable. Other features of the blockchain include decentralization, consensus mechanism, crowd-validated and trusted transactions, and crypto security. In this section, we will only describe the blockchain features relevant to ParaWare.\nThe consensus mechanisms of blockchains are designed to serve various purposes. For example, Proof of Work (PoW) is used by major blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum to ensure that each block is sealed by a random miner, thereby preventing data collusion. IPFS's Proof of Replication (PoRep), which is also used by ParaWare, ensures that a miner is actually storing a piece of useful data.\nPoW lets any number of miners take a shot at selecting its own set of transactions and solving the associated hash problem. The successful miner who solves the crypto hash problem (on his selected set of transactions) earns the right to seal the block. Once the block is sealed, it is broadcasted to all miners to validate. Once more than 50% of all miners have validated the sealed block, a new round of select-transaction-and-solve-hash-problem starts. The preset time for a new block generation is 10 minutes for Bitcoin and 15 seconds for Ethereum.\nProof of Stake (PoS) is a controversial mechanism that delegates the distributed ledger validation rights to a small group of ultra-rich token owners. To gain the right to validate a transaction, a miner must own and stake a large amount of tokens on his node. Compared to PoW, PoS concentrates the power of validation into a small pool of high-stake nodes, controlled by a small group of people instead of everyone.\nWeb 3.0 (abbreviated henceforth as Web3), which uses blockchain as the underlying infrastructure, is the next big thing after mobile Internet, as it returns data to its rightful owners. For example, instead of major Internet monopolies like Google and Instagram owning all your email/chat communications and social media postings, you own and control all data you created, including the ad revenues arising from all your data. That is the goal of Web3. We strongly believe that every Internet service will eventually migrate to Web3, as the latter makes the world a fairer place.\n"},"problem-statement/2.1-impossible-triangle-for-3d-gaming-and-the-metaverse.html":{"url":"problem-statement/2.1-impossible-triangle-for-3d-gaming-and-the-metaverse.html","title":"2.1 Impossible Triangle for 3D Gaming and the Metaverse","keywords":"","body":"2.1 Impossible Triangle for 3D Gaming and the Metaverse2.1 Impossible Triangle for 3D Gaming and the Metaverse\nFigure 1 shows the impossible Triangle for 3D Gaming.\n\nIn 3D gaming, the very best (AAA Graphics) games are typically playable only on the latest consoles or PC's with top-of-the-line GPU's (Graphical Processing Units), and therefore accessible by just a small portion of users (less than 25%).\nRecently, with the increasing network bandwidth brought about by the widespread availability of fibre-optic home broadband and 5G cellular networks, it is now possible to stream AAA games directly over WAN (Wide Area Networks) to a device equipped with low-end or integrated GPU, as reflected in the the left edge labeled \"video streaming\" of the impossible triangle in Figure 1. And this is exactly what cloud gaming does.\nUnfortunately, the costs of running a game remotely and streaming it to a player are exorbitant. Firstly, a dedicated remote virtual machine (VM) must be reserved for each player during the game session. Secondly, unlike video streaming, which is one (content) to many (viewers), each game play is different, and incurs its own dedicated network bandwidth that cannot be shared. And that is why global cloud gaming has not really caught on, and the vast majority of the cloud gaming platforms like Nvidia GeForce Now, Google's Stadia are loosing money. Therefore cloud streaming cannot satisfy the rightmost vertex of \"Low-cost Delivery\" of the impossible triangle in Figure 1.\nThe final vertex of the Impossible Triangle is \"Low-cost Delivery\", which traditionally means time-consuming OTA (Over The Air) downloads and upgrades. Further, as mentioned before, AAA games mostly work on the latest and greatest hardware, and is basically in-accessible to mobile devices unless there are watered-down versions specifically developed for it. And that is why the rightmost \"Download\" edge of the impossible triangle does not work for \"Any Device\".\nTo achieve the most widespread distribution (over most number of end-uers devices), HTML5 3D-games based on Egrets or COCOS engine can be developed. Unfortunately, these HTML5 engines are a few generations behind native 3D engines like Unreal and Unity. And a compromise can be made by playing sub-par (unrealistic) 3D games on HTML5. Even native unreal engine based games such as PUBG running on the most advanced mobile phones (iPhone13 as of August 2022) look crappy compared to their PC counterparts running GPU's that are 10-1000 times faster. That is why low-cost delivery to any device can only occupy the lowest edge of the impossible triangle in Figure 1.\n"},"problem-statement/2.2-parawares-solution.html":{"url":"problem-statement/2.2-parawares-solution.html","title":"2.2 ParaWare’s Solution","keywords":"","body":"2.2 ParaWare's Solution2.2 ParaWare's Solution\nParaWare aims to address all 3 vertices of the impossible triangle by harnessing the idle GPU power of the masses to run AAA games on-demand by streaming the game play to any device connected to the Internet. Think of ParaWare as the airbnb for idle GPU-owners (homes) and players (lodgers), with Web3 as the fair and transparent mechanism to incentivize usage. Specifically, miners contribute their GPU's to host AAA games, and players enjoy AAA graphics games on their average device. Players simply pay Miners with PWC (ParaWare Coins) on a per usage basis, akin to Airbnb lodgers paying daily rent to the home owners.\nThe following summarizes how ParaWare addresses all 3 vertices of the impossible triangle of Figure 1.

The server side computation can be done with such latency that it remains largely unnoticeable to the consumer save for the very competitive genres of shoot-em-up games.\nThe introduction of iPhone back in 2007 started a 15 year trend of shifting computing power from the server/cloud to the edge (client devices). The recent emergence of 5G low latency networks is gradually reversing that trend. Cloud gaming rides on this reversal, which moves the game from the client device to the cloud, i.e., the actual game runs in the cloud, with players seeing video streaming of the game screen, and sending controls at 50ms delay to the cloud.\nCloud gaming delivers real time play experience to different gaming devices while maintaining the player state. Users are able to play their favourite game anywhere, any time using a variety of gaming devices. Mobile device, a small, high mobility device with excellent cellular connection - 5G able to fulfil gamers' dream. The rise of cloud gaming is irreversible and especially when combined with Web3 technology, which reduces the cost substantially.\nAn unprecedented gaming experience awaits the future gamer with cloud gaming.

Without low level access to the App’s I/O stream, it requires extensive testing to extract a useable translation/mapping. This is especially true for mapping/translating a smart phone’s gestures, e.g., directional control, to the corresponding keystroke/s of a PC game that leads to smooth and intuitive game play.\nIdeally, if the App/Game developer is willing to open up their game API to PlayStream, substantial time-savings can be achieved. Likewise, the PlayStream client can receive hints from the game API on when to hide/show onscreen control pad, when playing a PC game on a mobile device.\nMoreover, the aforementioned non-trivial customization effort still pales in comparison to the full porting of one game to another platform, e.g., porting PC based Genshin to OSX.

They will first deploy the web2 game on ParaWare, and do all the necessary Input Device Profile (IDP) configuration, testing, optimization, and tweaking to ensure that their game runs smoothly on all target devices. At this stage, the ParaWare-enabled Web2 game simply uses Web3 for cloud usage accounting and payment. For example, individual users can buy PWC tokens to play the web3 enabled game on any device. Moreover, basic developers can optionally pre-pay for cloud usage, e.g., they could sponsor the first 1000 hours of cloud usage of their game on ParaWare to encourage user adoption; beyond the 1000 hours, individual players will have to fork out cash to buy PWC tokens to pay for additional cloud playtime. Other incentives like those of Axie Infinity are also possible if the game is web3 aware, e.g., reward winners with PWC tokens, which brings us to the next tier of Advanced Developer.\nAdvanced Developer\nThe advanced developer will modify or make their game fully web3 aware, so as to fully utilize the latter’s benefits including NFT entities (players, items, rewards), and play2earn economics. Legacy web2 games are unlikely to be fully web3 compatible, thus the advanced developer can make use of ParaWare’s web3 capabilities to perform active user tally, social networking, and other activities.\nThird-party or non-game developers can offer additional web3 API and/or B2C and B2B services such as search, recommendation, billboard, indexes, player rankings, guild programs, competitions, live-streaming, events, etc. These services will also run on PlayStream nodes, but would cost less (PWC) since they are unlikely to require GPU or video streaming.\nDevelopers can pre-pay miners to host their games and services, allowing end-users free-to-play for a limited time. This bootstraps the adoption of the game/services/api’s. Well-established games or services can gradually evolve into a pay-per-use setup (end-user paying for the services out-of-pocket), with free-to-play making up just a small fraction of the total.\n"},"paraware/4.2-incentives/4.2.2-miners.html":{"url":"paraware/4.2-incentives/4.2.2-miners.html","title":"4.2.2 Miners","keywords":"","body":"4.2.2 Miners4.2.2 Miners\nMiners provides the computation resources, i.e., PlayStream nodes, for games, services, and API’s to run on.

On the player side, the QoS is affected by the player’s network bandwidth, latency, stability, and device state (available compute power). Likewise, on the provider side, it is determined by the provider’s network bandwidth, latency, stability, and VM state. We penalize the provider for QoS issues arising from his network and machine.

A statistical approach can be used as follows.\nRecord player controls timestamp logs. Do this for all players of the same game. Apply NLP (Natural Language Processing) transformer models to the sequence of player controls, treating each control like a word in NLP, and determine the common sequences for the game/player.

On the contrary, anyone with an entry-level phone purchased after 2018 will now be able to enjoy full AAA graphics via ParaWare.\nSuppose a player wants to continue his/her TV ParaWare gaming session lying in bed, he could simply turn off the TV and open up his mobile phone ParaWare client and continue on from where he left off. Beyond that, users can even wear an entry-level VR headset to experience breathtakingly realistic 3D games.\n"},"conclusion/7.2-metaverse-for-everyone.html":{"url":"conclusion/7.2-metaverse-for-everyone.html","title":"7.2 Metaverse for everyone","keywords":"","body":"7.2 Metaverse for everyone7.2 Metaverse for everyone\nDue to the proliferation of online virtual worlds and the growing online social networks, there has been a flurry of interest and activity surrounding the Metaverse. This has led to numerous advancements in the field. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a rapid acceleration of the Metaverse movement, which has drived an increasing migration of resources (VC funds and manpower) from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0.\nThe desire for realistic Metaverse has also given virtual reality its long-awaited boost, with headsets selling at an unprecedented rate and decreasing prices. Current state-of-the-art VR 3K headsets from Meta are selling at US$299, but with graphics quality still way short of AAA.\nParaWare allows anyone with a phone or even a low-end VR headset (phone + cardboard VR set) to experience ultra-realistic AAA graphics. This will further drive the adoption of the Metaverse. We are confident that ParaWare will be one of the foundation building blocks for Web 3.0 3D gaming, and also eventually the Metaverse.\n"},"appendix/a.1-company-background.html":{"url":"appendix/a.1-company-background.html","title":"A.1 Company Background","keywords":"","body":"A.1 Company BackgroundA.1 Company Background\nThe Paraware team comprises 10+ professional members distributed globally.

A minimal bandwidth of 10 Mbps is needed to achieve 60 fps Full HD video streaming.\nDevelopers will need desktop hardware equivalent to 2 VM’s for compilation and simulation as a bare minimum. Typically developers will use a significantly faster GPU or GPU farm for 3D-rendering and ray-tracing.\nThe heaviest requirements are extolled on Miners, who are the core providers of ParaWare’s game streaming services. Miners will be penalized (by having their staked PWC confiscated) if their received Quality of Service goes below the agreed upon standard. Each mining machine runs multiple VM’s (Virtual Machines), servicing one game per VM per end-user. Thus a Mining machine should minimally serve 2 game connection requests simultaneously (20 Mbps bandwidth), with each game using 12-16 GB of memory and 1 GTX 1080-Ti class GPU. For economies of scale, a mining machine should serve 4 - 16 gamers, which corresponds to 64 GB ~ 256 GB of memory, 4~16 GTX 1080-Ti class GPU, and 40 Mbps ~ 160 Mbps network bandwidth.\nTable 6.

As such, we have established a total lifetime supply of 300 million tokens, to be released over 5 years, according to the schedule shown in Table 7 and Figure 6.\nThe proportions are as follows. 48% for mining rewards; 20% for investors; 10% for the core team; 10% for stakeholders; 6% for developers; and 6% for the ecosystem.

All activities conducted within the Paraware ecosystem will gradually burn the tokens.\nBased on a simple demand-supply logic, the PWC token will gradually increase in value over time due to its deflationary design. In addition, demand for the PWC token is expected to increase when it begins to circulate within the ecosystem, which may result in a hyper growth period of the token’s value.\nPWC will be openly traded on major cryptocurrency exchanges. It will be minted on the public Ethereum blockchain via the ERC 20 (Ethereum Token Standard). Any token created in accordance with the ERC-20 standard can be rapidly and effortlessly implemented since it is compatible with the Ethereum ecosystem's infrastructure. The Ethereum ecosystem is the ideal home for PWC due to its advanced features and number one market share.\n"},"appendix/a.5-roadmap.html":{"url":"appendix/a.5-roadmap.html","title":"A.5 RoadMap","keywords":"","body":"A.5 RoadMapA.5 RoadMap\nListed in reverse chronological order.\n\n2023.12\nParaWare Cloud Gaming Subscription Platform\n5 AAA games\nTarget: 1k DAU, 30k MAU\n\n\n\n\n2023.09\n1.0 release of ParaWare SDK\nCloud: Windows, Android (ARMv8)\nClient: PC, Android, Browser, iOS\n\n\n\n\n2023.06\nBeta release of ParaWare SDK\nCloud: Windows, Android (ARMv8)\nClient: PC, Android, Browser\n\n\n\n\n2023.01\nMOU signed with 10 Game Partners\nalpha release of ParaWare SDK\nCloud: Windows\nClient: PC, Android, Browser\n\n\n\n\n2022.09\nPre-A round\nMOU signed with 5 Game studios\n\n\n2022.08\nSeed round\nLaunch of ParaWare website on beeintelligence.io\n\n\n2022.06\nBeta release of ParaWare demo game\nCloud: Windows\nClient: PC, Android, Browser\n\n\n\n\n2022.05\nParaWare spin-off from MetaFantasy\n\n\n2022.04\nReleased alpha version of first ParaWare demo game\nClient: Windows PC standalone version (requires download)\n\n\n\n\n2021.06\nStarted ParaWare development\n\n\n2020.12\nFormed ParaWare Tech team\n\n\n2018.12\nBee Intelligence Group founded in Singapore\nWorked on HiChain project\n\n\n\n"},"appendix/a.6-go-to-market-strategy/":{"url":"appendix/a.6-go-to-market-strategy/","title":"A.6 Go-to-Market Strategy","keywords":"","body":"A.6 Go-to-Market StrategyA.6 Go-to-Market Strategy\nWord-of-mouth will be the number one guiding principle of our marketing strategy.
