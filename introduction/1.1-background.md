Games serve an essential purpose in society by acting as a primary source of entertainment, fostering social connection, and providing relief, and improving the overall quality of life. Now that we are starting to make a slow recovery from the global pandemic from 2020 to 2021, we are beginning to fully understand how the role of gaming has changed our lives irrevocably.

According to Newzoo's Global Games Market Report for 2021\[1], there were 3 billion gamers around the world in 2021, which helped generate revenues of US$175.8Billion. 2.8 billion of the worldâ€™s 3.0 billion gamers this year will play on a mobile device. This is compared to 1.4 billion on PC and 0.9 billion on console. The vast majority of the new revenues come from emerging markets, as the infrastructure and economies of regions such as Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Northern Africa continue to expand at a rapid rate.

The global cloud gaming market was valued at US$4.5 Billion in 2021, and it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 42.8 percent from 2021 to 2030, reaching US$111.3 Billion by 2030. The expansion of the market is being driven by a variety of factors, some of which include cross-platform gameplays, the growing popularity of cloud gaming, and the ease with which cloud-based games can be accessed.



Several market participants are coming out with new products, collaborating with other businesses, and making acquisitions in order to stay one step ahead of the competition. For example, in May of 2021, Blade and its associated cloud gaming service, Shadow, were acquired by Jezby Ventures, which in turn was established by Octave Klaba, the founder of OVHcloud. Ubitus K.K, Tencent, Sony Group Corporation, Shadow, NVIDIA Corporation, Blacknut, Google LLC, Amazon Luna, and Microsoft Corporation are some of the other major companies that offer cloud gaming end-user services.
