# 1.2 Cloud Gaming

Cloud gaming is a form of online video gaming that requires no downloads once the client App is installed. This is because games actually run on a remote server in the cloud; only the remote display/screen content is constantly refreshed/sent at 60 FPS (Frames Per Second) to the player over the network, and the player in turns sends control signals (keyboard, control pad, or button push) to the remote server. Think of cloud gaming as watching a controllable video, whereby the video content changes based on your actions/inputs. As most modern devices can stream Full HD video at 60 FPS, a low-end device suffices for anyone to enjoy the latest and greatest 3D titles without having to fork out money to buy expensive consoles or Graphics card. Neither is there a need for large local storage to store 3D models and maps, as all game states are stored remotely on the cloud.
